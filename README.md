## Instructions
1. Make Sure to edit the manifest.json file to incorprate your app  information.
2. You can add small buttons on the header, to make the app useful as a pwa. *Just make sure you copy the buttons already given for matching aesthetics.*
3. Edit the appshellfiles variable in the service worker to add your newly created files to cache, also make sure to edit the version no. befor every deploy.
4.  I Strongly suggest making the foreground and background of your app icon seperately, and later combine them in [Maskable App](https://maskable.app/editor)
