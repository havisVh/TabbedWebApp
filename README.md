## Instructions
<ol>
<li> Make Sure to edit the manifest.json file to incorprate your app  information.
<li> You can add small buttons on the header, to make the app useful as a pwa. *Just make sure you copy the buttons already given for matching aesthetics.*
<li> Edit the appshellfiles variable in the service worker to add your newly created files to cache, also make sure to edit the version no. befor every deploy.
<li> I Strongly suggest making the foreground and background of your app icon seperately, and later combine them in [Maskable App](https://maskable.app/editor)
